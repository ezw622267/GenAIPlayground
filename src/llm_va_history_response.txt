Early Virginia was shaped by the Jamestown Colony, founded in 1607. This initial settlement became a center for English colonization and marked the beginning of Virginia's journey toward becoming a powerful and influential state.  Facing harsh conditions and challenges like disease and conflict with Native American tribes, settlers struggled to establish a viable agricultural system. They relied on tobacco, which flourished in the region’s soil and attracted labor from African slaves who faced brutal treatment and exploitation.  This reliance on tobacco led Virginia to become one of the wealthiest colonies in the 17th century.

Despite its wealth, early Virginia was also marked by social and political tensions.  Differences between colonists from different backgrounds (landowners, merchants, planters) often clashed. A complex system of land ownership emerged, creating a hierarchical society with vast disparities in wealth and power. Conflicts with Native American tribes continued to be a major problem as the colonial government struggled to maintain control over lands and resources. The region also saw early political developments like Virginia's first representative assembly in 1619, which laid the groundwork for future governance.

The period from Jamestown’s founding to the later years of colonial America witnessed significant changes in Virginia. The colony’s agricultural economy thrived as tobacco became its cornerstone crop.  However, slavery's impact on society was undeniable and contributed to a growing tension between colonists.  Early attempts at education and religious tolerance emerged alongside challenges like the 1676 Bacon's Rebellion, which highlighted internal conflicts and the complex dynamics of colonial life. This period laid the groundwork for Virginia’s future as a vital component of the American colonies and as a state that would play a significant role in shaping early American history.
